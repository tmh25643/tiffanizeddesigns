				<h1>Marketing Resources for the Small Business Owner</h1>
				<p>Many small business owners wear a lot of hats&mdash;owner, employee, customer support, salesperson, and all too often, marketing department. Not everyone has a corporate-sized marketing budget and team to get the job done, and the skills needed may seem out of reach.</p>
				<p>If you find yourself in this situation, you can hire someone like me to create logos, websites, brochures and business cards. But what about those day-to-day marketing tasks that every small business owner runs into?</p>
				<p>You might be surprised to discover how many of these projects you can take on yourself without significant effort and cost. Here are some resources to help you tackle common marketing tasks on your own:</p>
				<p><strong>Email Marketing:</strong><br />If you have a list of emails that has gotten too large to send to individually, try out an email marketing automation company. There are several easy-to-use, cost-effective options, including Constant Contact, HubSpot, and MailChimp. These companies will help you maintain your lists, create attractive emails, and track the impact of your message.</p>
				<p><strong>Website Maintenance:</strong><br />It's a good idea to have a professional create and set up your website, but with just a few tutorials you may be able to maintain the site yourself. Website management software like Wix and Squarespace include accessible editing and publishing capabilities that most people can use right away. Just let me know if you want me to set up your site using one of these services so that you can carry out your own regular updates.</p>
				<p><strong>Printed Materials:</strong><br />If you find yourself running out of brochures, business cards, and other printed materials, online printing companies like Vistaprint, GotPrint, and MOO have customer-friendly uploading and printing services to provide quick, professional marketing materials. Even supply stores like OfficeDepot and Staples can turn around materials quickly, but they tend to be a little more expensive per piece and have limited capabilities for more sophisticated projects. Once I have designed your piece, I will provide all the files needed for you to print whenever you need them (though I also offer services to help you with reprints if you'd like).</p>
				<p>Some marketing projects do require an experienced hand, so if you find that you need something that these resources can't provide, I would <a href="contact.html">love the opportunity to assist you</a>.</p>
